# Reinforcement-Learning-Statistical-Arbitrage

Developed a Deep Q-learning algorithm in Python (PyTorch) to investigate optimal statistical arbitrage strategies in a simulated financial market environment featuring only one stock, which follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with an additional term to account for trading impact

Implemented a fully connected feed-forward neural network with 2 hidden layers of 100 neurons each, using ReLU activation functions to determine the optimal trading strategy based on input features such as current time, current stock price, and previous dayâ€™s trading action

Devised a novel visualization method to showcase the optimal trading execution strategies as a function of current portfolio position and stock price on different trading days
